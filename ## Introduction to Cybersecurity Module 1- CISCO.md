## Introduction to Cybersecurity - CISCO 
## Module 1 : Introduciton to Cybersecurity 
## 1.1 The World of Cybersecurity
# 1.1.1 What is Cybersecurity?
> Cybersecurity is the ongoing effort to protect individuals, organizations and governments from digital attacks by protecting networked systems and data from unauthorized use or harm.
> Three levels of protection: Personal, Organizational and Government. 
# 1.1.2 Protecting your personal data
> Offline vs Online identity: 
> Offline identity: real-life persona that you present on a daily basis at home, at school or at work. 
> Online identity: who you are and how you present yourself to others online. You can have an online identity just by using the web.
# 1.1.3 Your Online Identity
> Some other useful tips to help you generate your username: 
> - Don’t use your full name or parts of your address or phone number.
> - Don’t use your email username.
> - Don’t use the same username and password combination, especially on financial accounts.
> - Don’t choose a super-odd username and then reuse it again and again — it makes you easier to track.
> - Don’t choose a username that gives clues to your passwords such as a series of numbers/letters or the first part of a two-part phrase.
> - Do choose a username that’s appropriate for the type of account, i.e., business, social or personal.
# 1.1.4 Your Data
> Personal data describes any information about you. If the information falls into the wrong hands, it can be used to identify and impersonate you. 
> Ways hackers can get their hands on your personal data: medical records,  education records and employment and financial records.
# 1.1.5 Where is your data?
> Your data can travel and be exposed to multiple people and servers without you even realizing. 
# 1.1.6 What's More...
> Every time we collect or share personal data, we should consider our security. There are different laws that protect your privacy and data in your country.
# 1.1.7 Smart Devices
> Computing devices can generate information about you.
> Wearable technologies such as smartwatches and activity trackers collect your data for clinical research, patient health monitoring, and fitness and wellbeing tracking.
# 1.1.8 What Do Hackers Want?
> Can you think of an example that you have experienced yourself or that you have heard or read about, where cybercriminals have accessed or tried to access financial information online?: 
>   - An example I can think of is cybercriminals in Puerto Rico who try to act as Banco Popular (a bank in Puerto Rico) employees. They try calling people asking them for personal information to "unblock" their bank account. 
# 1.1.9 Identity Theft 
> Not only cybercriminals can destroy you financially, but also your life. 
> Example: medical theft and banking. 
# 1.1.10 Who Else Wants My Data?
> Your Internet Service Provider (ISP), advertisers, search engines and social media platforms and websites visited. 
## 1.2 Organizational Data
# 1.2.1 Types of Organizational Data
> 1.2.1.1 Traditional Data
> - Traditional data is typically generated and maintained by all organizations. It includes: transactional data, intellectual property and financial data.
> 1.2.1.2 Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data
> - IoT is a large network of physical objects, such as sensors, software and other equipment. All of these ‘things’ are connected to the Internet, with the ability to collect and share data.
# 1.2.2 The Cube
> The McCumber Cube is a model framework created by John McCumber in 1991 to help organizations establish and evaluate information security initiatives by considering all of the related factors that impact them. This security model has three dimensions:
> 1. The foundational principles for protecting information systems. The principles are: confidentiality, integrity and availability. 
> 2. The protection of information in each of its possible states. The states are: processing, storage and transmission. 
> 3. The security measures used to protect data. Those are: awareness, training and education, technology (software- and hardware-based solutions designed to protect information systems) and policy and procedure. 
# 1.2.3 What Do You Think?
> Phishing emails can be hard to detect. For example, they will often address you by name to appear legitimate, but hackers can easily find this information on the Internet. So, it’s important to stay alert and think before you click.
# 1.2.4 Is This for Real?
> Phishing is very common and often works. 
> - Case: Razer in 2020.
> Cloud cluster - a group of linked servers providing data storage, databases, networking, and software through the Internet.
> Organizations  need to take a proactive approach to cloud security to ensure that sensitive data is secured.
# 1.2.5 Data Security Breaches
> The implications of a data security breach are severe, but they are becoming all too common. 
> Examples: The Persirai botnet and Equifax Inc. 
> A DDoS attack occurs when multiple devices infected with malware flood the resources of a targeted system.
# 1.2.6 Consequences of a Security Breach
> - Reputational damage
> - Vandalism
> - Theft
> - Loss of revenue
> - Damaged intellectual property
## Lab: What was taken?
# 1.3.1 Scenario 1
> Attackers are constantly finding new and innovative ways of infiltrating organizations in search of valuable information.
# 1.3.2 What Happened?
> Fictional scenario of a hotel chain's web portal being compromised. Hackers took the names, email address and phone numbers of over three million hotel guests.
# 1.3.3 Scenario 2
> Hackers' intentions might be unclear when stealing, but if they have personal data they have everything needed to carry out widespread phishing or malware attacks.
# 1.3.4 What Exploits?
> What exploits did the hackers use in this case to gain access to valuable personal information?:`hackers were able to take advantage of an organization’s poor security practices.`
# 1.3.5 Rewind... 
> Every organization is at risk of a cyber attack and therefore must take appropriate action to protect itself.
> Security measures that could have been taken to prevent these security breaches were implementing multi-factor authentication for employees attempting to access sensitive data and vulnerability testing to make sure the system is secure.
> The organizations need to invest in improved security practices.This might include:
> - Investing in cybersecurity training for all staff so that they are aware of and able to spot a cyber attack
> - Enforcing two factor authentication for employees accessing files and applications that contain sensitive data
> - Maintaining log files and ongoing monitoring to identify anomalous behavior that might indicate a data breach
> - Storing the passwords of customers using a combination of salting and robust hashing algorithms
> - Separating cloud-based resources from the public Internet into an isolated private network segment
> - Granting employee access to personal data and internal systems only via a secure VPN connection.
# 1.3.6 Key Takeaways
> It’s important to be aware of common cyber threats and remain vigilant so that you don’t become the next victim.

## 1.4 Cyber Attackers
# 1.4.1 Types of Attackers
> 1. Amateurs: amateurs use existing tools or instructions found on the Internet to launch attacks
> 2. Hackers: This group of attackers break into computer systems or networks to gain access. Depending on the intent of their break in, they can be classified as white, gray or black hat hackers.
> - White hat attackers break into networks or computer systems to identify any weaknesses so that the security of a system or network can be improved. These break-ins are done with prior permission and any results are reported back to the owner.
> - Gray hat attackers may set out to find vulnerabilities in a system but they will only report their findings to the owners of a system if doing so coincides with their agenda. Or they might even publish details about the vulnerability on the internet so that other attackers can exploit it.
> - Black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerability for illegal personal, financial or political gain.
> 3. Organized hackers:These attackers include organizations of cyber criminals, hacktivists, terrorists and state-sponsored hackers. 
# 1.4.2 What Color Is My Hat? 
> White hat attackers aim to discover security weaknesses so that they can be improved, whereas black hat attackers take advantage of any vulnerabilities for illegal personal, financial or political gain. Gray hat attackers are somewhere in between. While they may not have malicious intentions, they want to get something for their discovery.
# 1.4.3 Internal and External Threats
> Internal threats:
>   Employees, contract staff or trusted partners can accidentally or intentionally:
>   - mishandle confidential data
>   - facilitate outside attacks by connecting infected USB media into the organization’s computer system
>   - invite malware onto the organization’s network by clicking on malicious emails or websites
>   - threaten the operations of internal servers or network infrastructure devices.
> External threats
>   Amateurs or skilled attackers outside of the organization can:
>   - exploit vulnerabilities in the network
>   - gain unauthorized access to computing devices
>   - use social engineering to gain unauthorized access to organizational data.
# 1.4.4 What Do You Think?
> Internal threats have the potential to cause greater damage than external threats.
## 1.5 Cyberwarfare
> Cyberwarfare - use of technology to penetrate and attack another nation’s computer systems and networks in an effort to cause damage or disrupt services, such as shutting down a power grid.
# 1.5.1 Sign of the Times (Stuxnet)
> Example of a state-sponsored attack: the Stuxnet malware. Designed not just to hijack targeted computers but to actually cause physical damage to equipment controlled by computers.
# 1.5.2 The Purpose of Cyberwarfare
> The main reason for resorting to cyberwarfare is to gain advantage over adversaries, whether they are nations or competitors.
