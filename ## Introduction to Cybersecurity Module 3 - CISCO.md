## Introduction to Cybersecurity - CISCO 
## Module 3: Attacks, Concepts and Techniques.
## 3.1 Protecting Your Devices and Network 
# 3.1.1 What Do You Think?
> Securing devives is a crutial step. 
# 3.1.2 Protecting Your Computing Devices
> To make your device safe and secure, you should:
> - turn the firewall on
> - install antivirus and antispyware
> - manage your operating system and browser
> - set up password protection.
> IoT devices pose an even greater risk than your other computing devices.
# 3.1.3 Wireless Network Security at Home
> Wireless networks allow Wi-Fi enabled devices, such as laptops and tablets, to connect to the network by way of a preset network identifier, known as the `service set identifier (SSID)`.
# 3.1.4 Public Wi-Fi Risks
> When using a public wi-fi make sure to verify that your device isn’t configured with file and media sharing and that it requires user authentication with encryption.In addition, you should also use an encrypted VPN service to prevent others from intercepting your information (known as ‘eavesdropping’) over a public wireless network.
# 3.1.5 Password Security
> It’s important that all of your online accounts have a unique password. Using the same passwords leaves you and your data vulnerable to cybercriminals.
# 3.1.6 A Strong Password
> Tips to help you when choosing a strong password:
> 1. Do not use dictionary words or names in any languages
> 2. Do not use common misspellings of dictionary words
> 3. If possible, use special characters such as ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )
> 4. Do not use computer names or account names
> 5. Use a password with more than ten characters
# 3.1.7 Using a Passphrase
> In order to prevent unauthorized access to your devices, you should consider using passphrases instead of passwords. A passphrase generally takes the form of a sentence (‘Acat th@tlov3sd0gs.’), making it easier for you to remember. And because it’s longer than a typical password, it’s less vulnerable to dictionary or brute-force attacks.
> Here are a few tips for creating a good passphrase.
> 1. Choose a statement that is meaningful to you
> 2. Add special characters such as ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( )
> 3. The longer the better
> 4. Avoid common or famous statements.
# 3.1.8 Password Guidelines
> The United States National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has published improved password requirements. 
> - Passwords should be at least eight characters, but no more than 64 characters.
> - Common, easily guessed passwords, such as ‘password’ or ‘abc123’ should not be used.
> - There should be no composition rules, such as having to include lower and uppercase letters and numbers.
> - Users should be able to see the password when typing, to help improve accuracy.
All printing characters and spaces should be allowed.
> - There should be no password hints.
> - There should be no password expiration period.
> - There should be no knowledge-based authentication, such as having to provide answers to secret questions or verify transaction history.
# 3.1.9 Password Check
> 1. Password123 : `weak`
> 2. Am@z0nPa55 : `strong`
> 3. !Lik3MySch001 : `strong`
> 4. April012000 : `weak`
> 5. 1q2w3e4r : `weak`
> 6. Iloveyou : `weak`
> 7. J0n@than#81 : `strong`
## 3.2 Data Maintenance 
# 3.2.1 What Is Encryption?
> `Encryption` is the process of converting information into a form in which unauthorized parties cannot read it. Only a trusted, authorized person with the secret key or password can decrypt the data and access it in its original form.
# 3.2.2 How Do You Encrypt Your Data?
> Software programs are used to encrypt files, folders and even entire drives.
> `Encrypting File System (EFS)` is a Windows feature that can encrypt data. It is directly linked to a specific user account and only the user that encrypts the data will be able to access it after it has been encrypted using EFS.
# 3.2.3 Back Up Your Data
> Having a backup may prevent the loss of irreplaceable data. To back up data properly, you will need an additional storage location for the data and you must copy the data to that location regularly. Additional storage locations: 
> 1. Home network
> 2. Secondary location
> 3. The cloud
# 3.2.4 Are They Really Gone?
> When you move a file to the recycle bin and delete it permanently, the file is only inaccessible from the operating system. Anyone with the right forensic tools could still recover the file due to a magnetic trace left on the hard drive.
# 3.2.5 How Do You Delete Your Data Permanently?
> To ensure you delete your files securely and permanently you should: 
> 1. To erase data so that it is no longer recoverable, it must be overwritten with ones and zeroes multiple times, using tools specifically designed to do just that. 
> 2. The only way to be certain that data or files are not recoverable is to physically destroy the hard drive or storage device.
## 3.3 LAB Who Owns Your Data? 
# 3.3.1 Terms of Service
> `The Terms of Service`, also known as `Terms of Use or Terms and Conditions`, is a legally binding contract that governs the rules of the relationship between you, the service provider and others who use the service.
# 3.3.2 Understand the Terms
> The Terms of Service will include a number of sections, from user rights and responsibilities to disclaimers and account modification terms.
> The data use policy outlines how the service provider will collect, use and share your data.
> The privacy settings allow you to control who sees information about you and who can access your profile or account data.
> The security policy outlines what the company is doing to secure the data it obtains from you.
# 3.3.3 What Are You Agreeing To?
> Is one truly aware of the choices we make?
# 3.3.4 The Data Use Policy
> While you are the owner of the content, the company could re-use any content you have shared for any purposes.
# 3.3.5 Privacy Settings
> Accepting the default privacy settings usually means that anyone can see information about you and access your profile.
# 3.3.6 Before You Sign Up
> The factors to keep in mind when signing up to an online service:
> 1. Have you read the Terms of Service?
> 2. What are your rights regarding your data?
> 3. Can you request a copy of your data?
> 4. What can the provider do with the data you upload?
> 5. What happens to your data when you close your account?
# 3.3.7 Protect Your Data
> You must always take appropriate action to protect your data and safeguard your account.
## 3.4 Safeguarding Your Online Privacy 
# 3.4.1 Two Factor Authentication
> Popular online services use two factor authentication to add an extra layer of security for account logins.
> Even with two factor authentication, hackers can still gain access to online accounts through phishing attacks, malware and social engineering.
# 3.4.2 Open Authorization
> `Open authorization (OAuth)` is an open standard protocol that allows you to use your credentials to access third-party applications without exposing your password.
# 3.4.3 Social Sharing
> In order to safeguard your privacy on social media, it’s important to share as little personal information as possible. You should also check your social media settings so that only people you know can see your activities or engage in conversations with you.
# 3.4.4 Don't Get Spoofed
> A simple forged or spoofed email can lead to a massive data breach and perhaps cause irreversible damage to your reputation.
# 3.4.5 Email and Web Browser Privacy
> These problems can be minimized by enabling the in-private browsing mode on your web browser. Many of the most commonly used web browsers have their own name for private browser mode.
> When private mode is enabled, cookies — files saved to your device to indicate what websites you’ve visited — are disabled. Therefore, any temporary internet files are removed and your browsing history is deleted when you close the window or program.
## 3.5 LAB Discover Your Own Risky Online Behavior 
# 3.5.1 Scenario 1- Question
> Photos showing bank details or valuable goods and vacation information always put you at risk, and especially when you’ve previously given clues about where you live, or where you are going to visit. 
# 3.5.2 Scenario 2
> Password manager applications can protect passwords by saving them in a secure encrypted form. They enable random passwords to be generated and managed easily, averting the need for users to have the same password for multiple accounts, which presents a security risk.
# 3.5.3 Scenario 3
> Connecting to an open Wi-Fi hotspot can make your system and data vulnerable to an attack.
# 3.5.4 Scenario 4
>  No organization can afford to take the risk of a cyber attack from installing applications from an untrusted source.
# 3.5.5 Scenario 5
> Clicking anything other than the close icon could put your system at risk.
> To be sure, you should run a system security scan with your trusted antivirus software on your computer. And you should always refuse or cancel update reminders unless you are sure they are from the official, trusted source.
# 3.5.6 Scenario 6
> Clicking on links in an email might seem safe, but often all is not what it seems.
> The key indications of a potential phishing email are signs that it has been sent from outside of the organization.
> Remember that even if you think the email is safe, you should always check with your IT department before clicking links to download anything.
